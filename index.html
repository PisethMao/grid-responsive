          This is a responsive card that adjusts its layout based on screen
          size. On small screens, cards stack vertically. On medium screens,
          three cards appear per row.

          The flexbox layout makes it easy to create responsive designs. The
          cards automatically wrap to the next line when there's not enough
          space.
